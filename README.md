Code samples from my talk: "Avoiding common pitfalls in AngularJS". 

The slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TDbjuLhDw2ubtBw_fiIs3kH6My-LbDs4sl_WCwz0pk/edit).

## Setup instructions

1. Install node.js (version 0.10.0 or newer), npm, git command-line client (version 1.8.4 or newer)
2. Run the following command (as superuser):
   * `npm install -g gulp`
3. Clone the project to your machine and run the following commands in the project directory:
   * `npm install`

## How to run the demos?

Run `gulp` and then open [http://localhost:7200/](http://localhost:7200/) in your web-browser.

We have set up a livereload gulp configuration, so you can make changes in the demos, and see the changes go live immediately.
